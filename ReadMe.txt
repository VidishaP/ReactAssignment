Step 1: Create an React App

command:
npx create-react-app assignment4
cd assignment4

This will create whole app with App.js, App.test.js,index.js and serviceWorker.js. Also, it will create respective css files too.

App.js will act like container of whole app which will include all src files. Apart from that, you can also create new .js files as needed. For example; header.js,footer.js and so on. 



Step 2 : Start app on localhost server

command:
npm start

This will redirect you to http://localhost:3000.
